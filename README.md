### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile, sit down and take a coffee.

Here I've made available all the projects I've developed since the beginning of my performance in dev, so you can follow my entire journey over these years.

There were ups and downs but I guarantee that I've never been better than now and I'm still looking for opportunities to develop the most difficult and fun app in the world, myself.
